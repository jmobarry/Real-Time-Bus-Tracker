# Real-Time-Bus-Tracker

Title: Real Time Bus Tracker Exercise

Description: This exercise utilizes a publicly available web API to obtain real time bus locations around the MIT campus and display the busses in motion on a Google maps canvas. Async functions are used to obtain the bus locations and update the markers representing the busses on the map.

How To Run: go to https://jmobarry.github.io/Real-Time-Bus-Tracker/ and watch the bus locations update every fifteen seconds.

Roadmap: In the future I would like to edit this map to reflect the real time bus data in my local area: Gaithersburg Maryland.
